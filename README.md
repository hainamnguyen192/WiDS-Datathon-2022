# WiDS-Datathon-2022
WiDS Datathon 2022 will address an important way to mitigate the effects of climate change with a focus on energy efficiency.
Description
WiDS Datathon 2022
In advance of the Women in Data Science (WiDS) Worldwide Conference to be held on March 7, 2022, we invite you to build a team, hone your data science skills, and join us for the 5th Annual WiDS Datathon focused on social impact.

This year’s WiDS Datathon, organized by the WiDS Worldwide team, Stanford University, Harvard University IACS, and the WiDS Datathon Committee, will address an important way to mitigate the effects of climate change with a focus on energy efficiency. The WiDS Datathon Committee is partnering with experts from many disciplines at Climate Change AI (CCAI), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and MIT Critical Data. This year’s datathon is open until February 26, 2022. Winners will be announced at the WiDS Conference via livestream, reaching a community of 100,000+ data enthusiasts across more than 85 countries.

The WiDS Datathon is now closed.

The Excellence in Research Award (Phase II) is open from March 8 - June 30. REGISTER HERE to participate in Phase II.

Background
Climate change is a globally relevant, urgent, and multi-faceted issue heavily impacted by energy policy and infrastructure. Addressing climate change involves mitigation (i.e. mitigating greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (i.e. preparing for unavoidable consequences). Mitigation of GHG emissions requires changes to electricity systems, transportation, buildings, industry, and land use.

According to a report issued by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the lifecycle of buildings from construction to demolition were responsible for 37% of global energy-related and process-related CO2 emissions in 2020. Yet it is possible to drastically reduce the energy consumption of buildings by a combination of easy-to-implement fixes and state-of-the-art strategies. For example, retrofitted buildings can reduce heating and cooling energy requirements by 50-90 percent. Many of these energy efficiency measures also result in overall cost savings and yield other benefits, such as cleaner air for occupants. This potential can be achieved while maintaining the services that buildings provide.

Overview: the dataset and challenge
The WiDS Datathon dataset was created in collaboration with Climate Change AI (CCAI) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). WiDS Datathon participants will analyze differences in building energy efficiency, creating models to predict building energy consumption. Participants will use a dataset consisting of variables that describe building characteristics and climate and weather variables for the regions in which the buildings are located. Accurate predictions of energy consumption can help policymakers target retrofitting efforts to maximize emissions reductions.

Who can participate
The dataset and challenge will be accessible to both beginners and experienced participants. For those who have never tried machine learning, we will be releasing a series of guides, tutorials, and webinars to help you get started with the algorithms and dataset. Many WiDS ambassadors will host datathon workshops, where participants will be able to receive mentorship, form teams, and hone their data science skills.

The WiDS Datathon aims to provide women with hands-on experiences addressing real-world problems, to inspire women worldwide to hone their data science skills, and to create a supportive environment for women to connect with others in their community who share their interests. Toward these ends, the WiDS Datathon is open to individuals or teams of up to 4 people; at least half of each team must be individuals who identify as women. Participants can be students, faculty, government workers, members of NGOs, or industry professionals.

How it works
The WiDS Datathon will run until February 26, 2022.

Data analysis can be completed using your preferred tools. Tutorials, sample code, and other resources will be posted throughout the competition on the WiDS website and on the Kaggle Discussion Forum. You will then upload your predictions for a test set to Kaggle and these will be used to determine the public leaderboard rankings and the winners of the competition.

Winners will be announced at the WiDS Worldwide Conference held in-person, and online, on March 7, 2022. Beyond the leaderboard rankings, individuals and teams will also have an opportunity to interact with our partners at Climate Change AI, Berkeley Lab, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and MIT Critical Data, submitting research papers about their work to be eligible for the WiDS Datathon Excellence in Research Award. This award is supported by the WiDS Datathon Committee, the National Science Foundation Big Data Innovation Hubs and Kaggle.

Special thanks to Kaggle for supporting the suite of WiDS Datathon cash awards this year, totaling $25,000 USD!

Evaluation
Evaluation Metric
The evaluation metric for this competition is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The RMSE is commonly used measure of the differences between predicted values provided by a model and the actual observed values.

RMSE is computed as: RMSE = sqrt ( (1/n)*sum(y_n - y_hat_n)^2 )

where

y_n is the n-th observed value and

y_hat_n is the n-th predicted value given by the model.

Submission Format
For every building (i.e. row) in the test dataset (test.csv), submission files should contain two columns: id and site_eui. id should be an integer andsite_eui should be a real value. For each row, these two values should be separated by a comma.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

id,site_eui
75757,1.3
75758,2.8
Leaderboard Standings
During the competition the leaderboard is calculated with approximately 51% of the test data. After the competition closes, the final standings will be computed based on the other 49%. Thus, the final leaderboard standings may be different than those during the competition.

Datathon Phase II: Excellence In Research Award
Datathon Phase II: Excellence in Research Award
In the Excellence in Research Award (Phase II), we will broaden our focus to examine the impacts of climate change across multiple domains.
